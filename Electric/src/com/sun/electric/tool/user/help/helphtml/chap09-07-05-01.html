<!-- HEADER 9-7-5-1: NCC GUI: Overview -->

When a designer runs NCC, and NCC finds mismatches, the NCC graphical
display window pops up displaying the mismatches. The display varies
from platform to platform. Below is a typical display with some
essential features.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-42.png" ALT="Figure9.42" BORDER=1></CENTER>
<P>
The left side of the window is a tree providing an overview of the kinds
of mismatches that NCC found. The right side has information
corresponding to the currently selected tree node(s).</P>
<P>
Each top-level tree node corresponds to a comparison of two cells. In
the above example, the label on the top-level node indicates that the
comparison that failed was between the cells: 
"E_pads{sch}" and "E_pads{lay}" in the library: "heater".
If the two cells have
different names or are from different libraries, then their names are
shown individually. For example, "libraryA:gateA{sch}
&amp; libraryB:gateB{sch}".
The number in square brackets at the right end of the cell names,
in this example "[14]",
is the number of mismatches.</P>
<P>
In general, if you see a tree node with a number in square brackets,
then this number is the total number of mismatches grouped under this
node.</P>
<P>
Selecting a top-level tree node displays the number of parts, wires, and ports
in the compared cells in the right part of the window.
For all other nodes, the right side of the window displays a list of
component names arranged in different ways, as described in
subsequent sections. Some components are highlightable, in which case
their names are printed as blue, red, or green hyperlinks.</P>
<P>
A top-level node has one or more subnodes. Subnodes can have the
following types: Exports, Parts, Wires, Parts (hash code), Wires
(hash code), Sizes, Export Assertions, Export/Global Network
Conflicts, Export/Global Characteristics Conflicts, and Unrecognized
Parts.
