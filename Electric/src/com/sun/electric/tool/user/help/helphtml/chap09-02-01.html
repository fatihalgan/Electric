There are three built-in design-rule checkers: <I>incremental</I>, <I>hierarchical</I>,
and <I>schematic</I>.
<P>
The incremental design-rule checker is always running, examining your layout,
and issuing error messages when an error is detected.
It checks only the current cell, and does not consider the contents of cell instances,
lower in the hierarchy.
It therefore offers an instant analysis, but not a complete one.
<P>
The hierarchical design-rule checker uses the same rules and techniques as the incremental checker,
but it checks all levels of hierarchy below the current cell.
To run it, use the <B>Check Hierarchically</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / DRC</B>).
To check only a selected subset of the current cell, use <B>Check Selection Area Hierarchically</B>.
<P>
The schematic design-rule checker looks for issues that make drawing or editing of the cell difficult.
These are the errors that is finds:
<OL>
<LI>Nodes:
	<UL>
	<LI>Nodes whose parameters don't match the cell definition (check export names, units, and visibility).</LI>
	<LI>"Stranded" pins: with no connections, exports, or attached text.</LI>
	<LI>"Inline" pins: those that sit in a line between two arcs (both of which could be replaced by a single straight arc).</LI>
	<LI>Invisible pins with text that is offset from the node center (this is an internal consistency check).</LI>
	</UL></LI>
<LI>Arcs:
	<UL>
	<LI>Unnamed arcs that "dangle": one end is unconnected and unexported (does not apply to busses).</LI>
	<LI>Bus arcs whose width is inconsistent with its two nodes.</LI>
	<LI>Bus pins that "float": do not connect to bus arcs and are not exported.</LI>
	<LI>Bus pins that connect to more than 1 wire.</LI>
	</UL></LI>
</OL>
<P>
After analysis of the circuit,
you can review the errors by typing "&gt;" and "&lt;" to step to the next and previous error that was found.
You can also see a list of errors in the cell explorer (see <A HREF="chap04-08.html#chap04-08">Section 4-8</A>).
