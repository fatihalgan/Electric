<!-- HEADER 9-7-5-8: NCC GUI: Advanced Features -->

<P>
The total number of mismatched cell
comparisons is displayed in square brackets on the top of the tree.
Only comparisons that did not pass NCC tests are counted and
displayed. Each failed comparison corresponds to one top-level tree
node. By default, NCC halts after the first failed comparison and,
therefore, the tree contains just one failed comparison.
If the user configures the NCC Preferences to continue
even after finding mismatched cells, then NCC compares all cells and
displays all that mismatch. When multiple cells have mismatches, the
left pane will display more than one top-level node as shown below.</P>

Right-clicking on a tree
node or a table cell pops up a menu with an option to copy the node
name or the cell text to the system clipboard (see below).</P>
