DXF (Drawing eXchange Format) is a solid modeling format used by
<A HREF="http://www.autodesk.com">AutoCAD</A> systems.
For more information on reading and writing DXF, see
<A HREF="chap03-09-02.html#chap03-09-02">Section 3-9-2</A> and
<A HREF="chap03-09-03.html#chap03-09-03">Section 3-9-3</A>, respectively.

<TABLE><TR><TD>
DXF settings are controlled with the DXF Project Settings
(in menu <B>File / Project Settings...</B>, "DXF" tab).
<P>
This dialog controls the list of acceptable DXF layers.
These layers can be typed into the edit field, separated by commas.
If a layer name in the DXF file is not found in the list of acceptable layers, it will be ignored.
<P>
To control scaling, you can change the meaning of units in the DXF file.
The default unit is "Millimeters",
which means that a value of 5 in the DXF file becomes 5 millimeters in Electric.

Other DXF settings are controlled with the DXF Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "I/O" section, "DXF" tab).
For the difference between Preferences and Project Settings, see
<A HREF="chap06-03.html#chap06-03">Section 6-3</A>.
<P>
By default, Electric flattens DXF input, removing levels of hierarchy and creating a single cell with the DXF artwork.
By unchecking the "Input flattens hierarchy", Electric will preserve the structure of the DXF file.
<P>
If you check "Input reads all layers", then all layers are read into Electric,
regardless of whether the layer names are known.
