<!-- HEADER 9-7-1: NCC Overview -->


Electric can compare two different cells and determine whether their
networks have the same topology.  This operation is sometimes called
Layout vs. Schematic (LVS), but because Electric can compare any two
circuits (including two layouts or two schematics) we use the term Network
Consistency Checking (NCC).
<p>
The Java Electric NCC differs from the C Electric NCC in two
significant ways.
<UL>
<LI>
  The Java Electric NCC firsts attempts to discover circuit mismatches
  using a new algorithm called "Local Partitioning".  We do this
  because Local Partitioning provides much more precise and
  intelligible mismatch diagnostics.  We fall back upon the <A
  HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/lis/www/gemini/gemini.html">
  Gemini algorithm</A> (Ebeling, Carl, "GeminiII: A Second Generation
  Layout Validation Program", <I>Proceedings of ICCAD</I> 1988,
  p322-325.) only as a last resort. In practice upwards of 95% of all
  errors are found by Local Partitioning.
</li>
<li>
  The Java Electric NCC has a "hierarchical" mode. When comparing a
  cell hierarchically, NCC first tries to compare the cell's
  descendents.  We <i>strongly</i> recommend this mode to the user
  because it allows the Local Partitioning algorithm to provide even
  more precise and intelligible mismatch diagnostics.
</li>
</ul>
The Java Electric NCC is also significantly faster than the C Electric
NCC.  For example, for one of our chips, C-NCC flat took 48 minutes,
Java-NCC flat took 3.5 minutes, and Java-NCC hierarchical took 9
seconds.
<p>

<h3> Limitations </h3>
NCC has a number of limitations
<ul>
<li>
  NCC does not check the substrate connection of transistors. This is
  because Electric does not keep track of the connectivity
  of the substrate connection of layout transistors. In fact, layout
  transistors don't have substrate ports. We plan to remedy this.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Example </h3>

For an example of network consistency checking, open the Samples
library with the <B>Sample Cells</B> command (in menu <B>Help / Load Built-in Libraries</B>) and compare the
cells "tool-NCC{lay}" and "tool-NCC{sch}".  These two cells are
equivalent and the checker will find them to be so.
