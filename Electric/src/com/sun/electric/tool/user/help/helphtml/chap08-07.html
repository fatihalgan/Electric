<H3>The Support Cell</H3>
<P>
Each cell in a technology library describes a different aspect of the technology.
The <I>support</I> cell contains technology-wide information.
To see this, edit the cell "factors" under the "TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT" section
of the cell explorer.

The support cell contains many items, any of which can be changed by double-clicking on it.
<UL>
<LI>"Scale" is the scaling factor between grid units and nanometers.</LI>
<LI>"Description" is the full description of the technology.</LI>
<LI>"Minimum Resistance" is the minimum resistance for the technology
(see <A HREF="chap09-10-01.html#chap09-10-01">Section 9-10-1</A> for this and other parasitics).</LI>
<LI>"Minimum Capacitance" is the minimum capacitance for the technology.</LI>
<LI>"Gate Shrinkage" is the gate shrinkage for the technology.</LI>
<LI>"Gates Included in Resistance" tells whether to include a transistor's gate in resistance computations.</LI>
<LI>"Parasitics Includes Ground" tells whether to include ground networks in parasitics computations.</LI>
