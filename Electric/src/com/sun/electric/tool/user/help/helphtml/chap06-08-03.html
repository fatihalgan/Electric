<!-- HEADER 6-8-3: Modifying Text -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Text/Change Text Size... -->

Like nodes and arcs, text can be moved simply by clicking and dragging.
It can be erased with the <B>Selected</B> command of the <B>Edit / Erase</B> menu (the Delete key).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
To change text, double-click on it and type new values.
To change other aspects of selected text, and use the
<B>Object Properties...</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Properties</B>).
This dialog allows modification of the text, size, font, style, anchor-point, rotation,
 color,
and even the offset of the anchor-point from the attached node or arc.
Note that the offset is always relative to the center of the attached object.
The size of text can be absolute (given in "points") or relative (given in units).
The font of the text can be the default font or any font installed on your system.
The style of text can be any combination of Italic, Bold, or Underline.
Text rotation can be in 90-degree increments only.
You can set the units to any electrical type (capacitance, resistance, etc.)
See <A HREF="chap07-02-02.html#chap07-02-02">Section 7-2-2</A> for more on these units.

<P>
The "Code" option allows the text to be code in an interpretive language,
in which case, the evaluation of that code is displayed.
You can choose to show the text value, the name of the piece of text, or both.
<P>
If the text contains more than 1 line,
then you must check "Multi-Line Text" in order to edit it.
You may then have to stretch the dialog in order to have a larger field for editing the text.
The "Highlight Owner" button highlights the node or arc on which the text is attached.
The checkbox "Invisible outside cell" requests that the text not be drawn when an instance of the cell is examined.

The <B>Change Text Size...</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Text</B>)
allows you to change the size, font, and style of any text object.
You can choose which of the 6 classes of text you wish to change,
and you can choose whether to make the changes only on selected objects, in the current cell,
in all cells of a particular view, or everywhere.
