<!-- HEADER 6-8-2: Selecting Text -->

The only category of text that is not selectable is the text that is integral to a node's graphics
(i.e. the Flip-Flop).
For the rest, you can select and manipulate the text just as you would the object on which the text resides.
(Note that port names on cell instances are not selectable:
instead, select their export name inside of the cell definition.)
<P>
Certain types of text are not easily selectable.
This is a feature that prevents accidental selection of unwanted text.
For such hard-to-select text,
the only way to select them is to use
<I>special select</I> mode (see <A HREF="chap02-01-05.html#chap02-01-05">section 2-1-5</A>).
By default, the name of an unexpanded cell instance is hard-to-select.
However, you can also request that names on nodes and arcs
also be difficult to select by unchecking "Easy to Select" in their <B>Object Properties...</B>
dialogs.

<TABLE><TR><TD>
All text is attached to its node or arc at an <I>anchor-point</I>.
This is the one point on the text that never moves,
regardless of the size of the text.
The highlighting of selected text varies according to the anchor-point.
Typically, the highlighting consists of an "X" through the text.
This indicates that the anchor-point is in the center.
If a "U" is drawn in any of four orientations,
it indicates that the anchor-point is on the side and that the text grows out of the opened end.
If an "L" is drawn in any of four orientations, it indicates that the anchor-point is in a corner.

<P>
Finally, the text may be drawn with an "X" but also have four lines that indicate a box at the object edge.
This is centered text that clips to the size of its attached object
(it is <I>boxed</I>).

Note that text can be moved away from its attached node or arc.
If this has been done, then selection of the text will also indicate the attached component
by drawing a dashed line to it.
