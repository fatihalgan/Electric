<TABLE><TR><TD>
Some cells are textual in nature (VHDL, Verilog, Netlists, or Documentation), and cause text to appear in the edit window.
<P>
When text editing, the standard point-and-click commands apply.
You can use the <B>Cut</B>, <B>Copy</B>, and <B>Paste</B> commands (in menu <B>Edit</B>).

<P>
The contents of a text window can be saved to disk with the <B>Text Cell Contents...</B>
command (in menu <B>File / Export</B>)
and restored from disk with the <B>Text Cell Contents...</B> command (in menu <B>File / Import</B>).
<P>
Note that there is no "saving" of text windows because they are editing internal data structures.
Therefore every change updates the information in Electric
(but the library must be saved to truly preserve changes).

<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig04-13.png" ALT="Figure 4.13"></CENTER></TD><TD>
Text searching is done with the <B>Find Text...</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Text</B>).
You can find and/or replace text with the appropriate buttons.
Check boxes allow the search to be case sensitive, have regular expressions,
and to go in the reverse direction.
In addition, you can jump directly to a specified line number.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Interestingly, the <B>Find Text...</B> command can also be used outside of the text edit window.
If you are editing a layout or schematic, this dialog will search all of the node, arc, export, and other names.
The checkboxes in the "Objects to Search" area control which of these pieces of text will be considered.
"Automatically Generated" names are those created for you by the system.
They can be included in the search but normally are not.
