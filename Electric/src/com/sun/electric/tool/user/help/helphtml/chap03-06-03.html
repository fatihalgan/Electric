<!-- HEADER 3-6-3: Export Deletion and Movement -->

<!-- COMMAND Export/Delete Export -->
<!-- COMMAND Export/Delete Exports on Selected -->
<!-- COMMAND Export/Delete Exports in Highlighted Area -->
<!-- COMMAND Export/Move Export -->

You can delete an export simply by selecting its name and using the <B>Selected</B>
command of the <B>Edit / Erase</B> menu (or typing the Delete key).
You can also use the <B>Delete Export</B> command (in menu <B>Export</B>).
<P>
To remove many exports at once,
the <B>Delete Exports on Selected</B> command removes all exports on all highlighted nodes.
Also, the <B>Delete Exports in Highlighted Area</B> command removes only those exports that are in the selected area.
When an export is deleted, all arcs connected to that port on instances of the current cell
(higher up the hierarchy) are also deleted
(see <A HREF="chap02-03.html#chap02-03">Section 2-3</A>).
<P>
To move export text, simply select it and drag it.
The location of the text has no effect on the location of the export:
moving the text is only for improvement of the display.
However, if you check "Move node with export name" in the
Ports/Exports Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Ports/Exports" tab),
then moving an export name will cause the node (and the export) to move as well.
<P>
It is sometimes desirable to keep an export but to transfer it to another node.
If a cell is in use higher in the hierarchy,
unexporting and then reexporting deletes all existing connections.
Instead, the <B>Move Export</B> command (in menu <B>Export</B>) can be used.
Before using this command,
two nodes and their ports must be highlighted with
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">left</A></I>
button and
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">shift-left</A></I> button.
The export is moved from the first node to the second node.
