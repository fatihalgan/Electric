<!-- HEADER 4-7-2: Aligning to a Grid -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Move/Align to Grid -->

When moving or creating circuitry,
the cursor location is snapped to a grid so that editing is cleaner.
This snapping is controlled by the alignment options
(which are not necessarily the same as the grid options).

The Grid Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Grid" tab)
presents a dialog in which alignment values may be set.
For example, if the grid spacing is 2x3, and the alignment is 0.5,
then there are up to six different positions for placement inside a displayed grid rectangle.
<P>
Because there are distance settings, there are 3 alignment values.
The settings are labeled "Full", "Half", and "Quarter", so sensible users should scale the values accordingly.
However, for more flexibility, any value can be entered here.
The settings are controlled by the toolbar icons and the commands in the <B>Edit / Modes / Movement</B> menu
(see <A HREF="chap02-04-01.html#chap02-04-01">Section 2-4-1</A>).

<P>
The <B>Align to Grid</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Move</B>)
cleans up the selected objects by moving them to aligned coordinates.
This is useful for circuitry that has been imported from external sources,
and needs to be placed cleanly for further editing.
