If you wish to find the distance between any two points on the display,
use the "Measure" tool from the tool bar.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
This mode can also be invoked with the
<B>Toggle Measure Distance</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Modes / Edit</B>).
Another way to measure distances is to use the cursor coordinates, displayed in the status area.
<P>
In measure mode, each click places a new point on the display, and shows the distance to the previous point.
Clicking the right button lets you start a new measure point without connecting it to the previous one.
Double-clicking the right button removes the measurements.
<P>
The measured distance can be used by the <B>Array...</B> command (in menu <B>Edit</B>) to specify spacing
(see <A HREF="chap06-04.html#chap06-04">Section 6-4</A>).
