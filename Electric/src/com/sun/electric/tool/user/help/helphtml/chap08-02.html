<H3>Converting Technologies to Libraries</H3>
<P>
The best way to create a new technology is to change an existing one.
Use the <B>Convert Technology to Library for Editing...</B> command
(in menu <B>Edit / Technology Specific</B>) and select a similar technology.
Unfortunately, the Schematic and Artwork technologies are too complex to edit and cannot be converted.
<P>
Conversion of a technology to a library creates a library with the same name as the technology.
Note that technologies with settings (such as MOSIS CMOS)
will be converted with their current settings only, and the options will no longer be available.
<P>
<H3>Technology-Editing Mode</H3>
<P>
Once a technology-library has been created,
editing of its cells is done in a special <I>technology-editing mode</I>.
The system knows to use technology-editing mode because the cells are marked
as being "Part of a technology editor library"
(see the <B>Cell Properties...</B> command of the <B>Cells</B> menu,
see <A HREF="chap03-07-03.html#chap03-07-03">Section 3-7-3</A>).
<P>
<H3>Converting Libraries to Technologies</H3>
<P>
To convert a technology-library into a technology, use
the <B>Convert Library to Technology...</B> command.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
You are given the opportunity of naming the technology, and can also request that Java code be produced
(this code can be compiled with Electric to install the technology permanently).
If a technology already exists with the name you want, you can request that it be renamed,
or you can choose a different name for the new technology
(note that technologies can also be renamed with the <B>Rename Current Technology...</B> command).

<P>
If there is an error in the library, conversion is aborted and you are given a chance to fix the library.
Generally, the offending part of the library is highlighted.
If no errors have occurred in the translation,
there will be a new technology in Electric and it will be the current one.
<P>
Before creating any circuitry with the new technology,
it is advisable to create a new library (use the <B>New Library...</B> command of menu <B>File</B>)
so that the test circuitry is not stored with the library that describes it.
<P>
<H3>Cleaning Up</H3>
<P>
After a few rounds of technology editing, there may be many libraries and technologies.
You can delete the current library with the <B>Close Library</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu
(to make another library current,
use the <B>Change Current Library...</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu).
<P>
<H3>Using Technology Libraries</H3>
<P>
Once a library has been successfully built that describes a technology,
it can be saved to disk with the <B>Save Library</B>
command of the <B>File</B> menu.
Then, in another session of Electric, it can be read from disk and converted to a technology.
