<!-- HEADER 9-7-5-2: NCC GUI: Exports -->

<P>
The exports node is always a leaf node with the name "Exports
[X]", where "X" is
the number of export mismatches in this comparison.
Selecting an exports node displays a table on the right side of the
NCC graphical window (see below). The table has two columns -
one per compared cell. The header contains cell names. Each row
corresponds to a mismatch. A table cell has zero or more <I>export
lists</I>. An export list is a list of all the exports found on a
network and is displayed as a list of export names surrounded by
curly brackets "{ }". Each export
list is a single hyperlink which highlights all the exports in the
list.</P>
<P>
Multiple export lists in a table cell occur when a single network in one
design (e.g. the schematic) has one or more exports that match
multiple exports attached to more than one network in the other
design (e.g. the layout). For example, the mismatch on the third row
from the top in the figure below has layout exports (the second column)
attached to a single network matching schematic exports (the first
column) attached to two networks.</P>

<P>
An empty table cell means one design has exports that match no exports
with the same names in the other design. For example, the mismatch in
the top row above has the layout export "E_core_sclk"
matching no exports in the schematic.</P>
<P>
Some exports are <I>implied</I>. For example, if a schematic cell uses a
global ground, but does not contain an export for that ground, then
NCC will automatically insert an implied
export for ground. This
is done because most often the corresponding layout cell has a ground
export, and we want the schematic and layout cells to match. Implied
exports are not hyperlinked and have ":implied" added to their names (see below).</P>
<P>
When NCC does not find any topological mismatches, it attempts to suggest
possible matches for exports that failed to match by name. Such
<I>suggestions</I> are printed in green. The first row of the table
below indicates that the "outO[1][T]"
export in the layout topologically matches the "outO[T]"
export in the schematic, even though they have different names. The
second row indicates that the "outE[1][F]"
export in the layout topologically matches the "net@4[1]"
wire in the schematic, even though the "net@4[1]"
wire has no exports. Note that a wire name is not an export list and
is not surrounded by curly brackets.</P>

<P>
Exports that match by name, but are not on equivalent networks, have red
hyperlinks. Such exports might have suggested matches as well, 
which are printed in green. In the first row of the table below,
the "jtag[1]" export in the
schematic does not topologically match the "jtag[1]"
export in the layout, but does match the "jtag[8]"
export in the layout.</P>
