Cell graphing shows the hierarchical structure of your circuit.
The graph is stored in a new cell called "CellStructure", built from Artwork nodes.
<P>
The <B>Graphically, Entire Library</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Cell Info</B>)
displays a graph of every cell in the library.
The <B>Graphically, From Current Cell</B> command displays a graph that places the current cell at the top.
<P>
A cell graph can be edited like anything else in Electric.
Click and drag the cell names to rearrange the graph.
