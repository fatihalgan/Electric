<P>
Because Electric captures connectivity information during design,
there is no need for "node extraction", the process of extracting connectivity from layout.
However, there are situations where a circuit has only layout and no connectivity,
specifically when a circuit has been read into Electric from CIF, GDS, or other formats
that have no connectivity information in them
(see <A HREF="chap03-09-02.html#chap03-09-02">Section 3-9-2</A>).

<P>
When CIF, GDS, and other foreign file formats are read into Electric, the cells they create
are composed entirely of pure-layer nodes
(see <A HREF="chap07-01-01.html#chap07-01-01">Section 7-1-1</A>).
These nodes appear to represent the circuit correctly, and can even be written back out
to CIF or GDS correctly.
But the missing connectivity information means that Electric cannot properly analyze these
circuits (cannot do DRC, simulation, etc.)
<P>
The solution is to convert this geometry into properly connected components.
To convert the current cell into connected geometry, use the <B>Extract Current Cell</B>
command (from menu <B>Tool / Network</B>).
To convert the current cell and all subcells, use the <B>Extract Current Hierarchy</B> command.
Electric creates new versions of the layout cells that have higher-level nodes and arcs in them.
<P>
Although the process of converting layout into connectivity information is difficult,
it can usually be done correctly.
In Electric, this process is complicated by the fact that the resulting connectivity information must
be expressed as a set of "high-level" primitives (transistors and contacts) which have their own
ways of appearing in the layout.
Therefore, it is not always possible to extract layout precisely.
For example, the design rules for a transistor typically require that polysilicon extend beyond
the gate area by 2 units, so transistor primitives typically have this extra geometry built into them.
But what would happen if the geometry to be extracted extends by 3 units?
Electric adds an extra 1-unit arc to fill-out the geometry that it finds.
Worse yet, what would happen if the geometry extends by only 1 unit?
Electric simply cannot represent this with its primitives.
It will create the transistor, but it will no longer match the original geometry.
In general, the system attempts to create high-level primitives that mimic the original geometry.
It often leaves small pure-layer nodes behind to complete the extraction.
As an aid in debugging the extraction process, these extra pure-layer nodes are highlighted
in the resulting cell.

Two Network Preferences are available to control the extraction process
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Network" tab).
<P>
The first is "Force exact cut placement", which requires that the cut (or via) locations
appear exactly in the same place once extracted.
Without this preference, Electric will find contact areas and replace them with contact nodes
regardless of where those nodes place the cuts.
With this preference selected, Electric will place contact nodes in such a way that the cut
layers land in the correct original locations.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The disadvantage of forcing exact cut placement is that Electric will create many contact
nodes, one for each cut layer.
In multi-cut situations, this may be many more nodes than are necessary.
<P>
The other preference is "Grid-align geometry before extraction".
Doing this makes the extraction process run more smoothly, but may cost slightly in accuracy.
