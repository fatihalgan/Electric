Electric has the concept of a <I>current technology</I> which is shown in the
status bar.
This technology affects many things, including the selection of nodes and arcs in the component menu.
There are a number of ways to affect the current technology, both manual and automatic.
<P>
You can change the current technology by selecting it from the popup at the top of the
side bar (either the "Components" or "Layers" tab).
Electric automatically switches the current technology to match the cell being edited.
If there are multiple cells being edited from different technologies, this switching can become annoying.
To disable automatic technology switching,
use the Nodes Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "Nodes" tab),
and uncheck "Switch technology to match current cell".
<P>
To see a list of primitive nodes and arcs in the current technology,
use the <B>Describe this Technology</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Technology Specific</B>).
To see a detailed description of the current technology,
use the <B>Document Current Technology</B> command.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Some technologies have settings that further customize them.
The Technology Project Settings command (in menu <B>File / Project Settings...</B>, "Technology" tab)
lets you control many general and specific technology settings.
More information about the MOSIS CMOS section can be found in

<P>
The Defaults section has these controls:
<UL>
<LI>"Startup technology" controls the technology that is used when Electric first begins.
It is also used when reading old libraries that are missing some technology information.
</LI>
<LI>"Layout technology to use for Schematics" sets the technology to use for real geometry
(an integrated circuit technology, not a schematics or artwork technology).
The default layout technology is used to give further information about schematics components
(see, for example, <A HREF="chap09-04-03.html#chap09-04-03">Section 9-4-3</A>).
</LI>
</UL>

Other settings are found in the Technology Preferences dialog
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Technology" section, "Technology" tab)
For the difference between Preferences and Project Settings, see
<A HREF="chap06-03.html#chap06-03">Section 6-3</A>.
<P>
Layout Technology preferences are discussed in <A HREF="chap07-04-02.html#chap07-04-02">Section 7-4-2</A>.
Artwork controls are discussed in <A HREF="chap07-06-01.html#chap07-06-01">Section 7-6-1</A>).
Schematics controls are discussed in <A HREF="chap07-05-01.html#chap07-05-01">Section 7-5-1</A>
